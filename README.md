### 💼 My Experience

At **MDA Space**, I’ve worked on everything from container orchestration to satellite test-data pipelines. I currently design production-grade systems for space missions — including a full pipeline that processes Touchstone satellite data and outputs analytics reports in HTML, PDF, and Parquet. I also help with automation around Azure deployments and contribute to internal tooling and documentation that supports new hires.

At **Amazon**, I worked in their Data Center Engineering division where I developed a real-time dashboard to visualize thousands of metrics. I also automated workforce scheduling and monitoring tasks dramatically reducing manual overhead.

My earlier experience at **Exo** focused on building scalable data pipelines using Python and Pandas to clean and transform large engineering datasets.
